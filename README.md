# Developer Tools for QBCore FiveM

* Made by Atiya

* Discord: atiya.

* Github: https://github.com/MAtiyaaa

  

# Description

*  **A bunch of tools I've used to ease my developing process.**

*  **Uses commands to trigger multiple features that would make your day-to-day dev life somewhat less annoying.**

*  This was not meant to be a release, as I just made this to make my life a bit easier so some of the code available is probably useless and/or overdoing it

  

# Preview
* **Feature**: Developer **menu** with all options available as an alternative to using commands.
